Bimanual Humanoid with PerAct^2
===============================

**PerAct^2** is a language-conditioned behavioral cloning agent, an extension
of the PerAct framework for bimanual robotic manipulation. 
Our `project website <http://bimanual.github.io>`_ features details about the system architecture
and more results. Please contact me if you are interested in the integration.
The bimanual agent predicts a 6-D pose and is connected to the robot software stack `ArmarX <https://armarx.humanoids.kit.edu/>`_.
